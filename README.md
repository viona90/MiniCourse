# Study-Case-MiniCourse
In this repository, I have documented a case study from a mini course or bootcamp I attended, 
focusing on using Python for data cleaning and preparation before analysis. 
We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:

1. Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)
2. Check data duplicate and null
3. Drop data duplicate and NaN values from DataFrame
4. Check Outliers
5. Removing rows based on a condition

Once I have cleaned up our data a bit, I move the data exploration section using Python's libraries 
like Matplotlib and NumPy, or utilizing visualization tools.

Through this case study, I demonstrated the process of data cleaning and preparation using Python. 
By leveraging various libraries and tools, I transformed raw data into a cleaned, structured format suitable for analysis. 
The subsequent data analysis steps, powered by libraries like Matplotlib and NumPy, facilitated the extraction of insights and trends from the data. 
This repository serves as a valuable resource for showcasing my skills in data cleaning, preparation, and analysis.
